            <p class="faq-question">How common are equine stomach ulcers?</p>
            <p class="faq-answer">
              Equine stomach ulcers have been found in horses from a wide variety of breeds, disciplines and ages, including:<br>
                •	  90% of racehorses<br>
                •	  70% of non-racing performance horses<br>
                •	  50% of foals
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p class="faq-question">What causes equine stomach ulcers?</p>
            <p class="faq-answer">
              Equine stomach ulcers are caused because in the wild, horses eat for about 20 hours a day and produce saliva from 60,000 chews per day. When stabled horses don’t eat for as long and do not have to work as hard for their food, with as few as 20,000 chews per day and produce less saliva so the acid that is constantly being produced in the horse’s stomach has no food to break down and therefore breaks down the stomach lining forming an ulcer.

          </li>
          <li>
            <p class="faq-question">Why is it important to prevent equine stomach ulcers?</p>
            <p class="faq-answer">
              Painful equine stomach ulcers reduce performance and can even lead to death. They can occur in as little as 5 days for horses under stressful conditions, but they may go undiagnosed for long periods of time.

            <p class="faq-question">What are some of the stress factors that can lead to equine stomach ulcers?</p>
            <p class="faq-answer">
              Everyday activities that may not seem stressful to you at all can lead to equine stomach ulcers:<br>
              •	Competition<br>
              •	Training<br>
              •	Travel<br>
              •	Trailering<br>
              •	Weekend shows or events<br>
              •	Confinement<br>
              •	Limited turnout or grazing<br>
              •	Lay-up due to sickness or injury<br>
              •	Changes in routine<br>
              One study showed how easy it is for recreational horses to develop stomach ulcers in just 5 days.

            <p class="faq-question">Why does my horse need FenuHealth Products?</p>
            <p class="faq-answer">
              If you could keep your horse on pasture, and you could rotate pasture from time to time, there would be few demands on its digestive system and your horse would most likely get the nutrition it needs if it is not in work.

            <p class="faq-question">My horse chews the wood in his stable. Will FenuHealth Products help this?</p>
            <p class="faq-answer">
              Many believe wood chewing, or “cribbing”, is generally believed to be a sign of an underlying digestive health issue. However, every horse is unique. You should consult with your veterinarian to determine the underlying cause of your horse’s condition. Feeding FenuHealth products and in particular FenuSave and FenuCare may be appropriate for your horse.

            <p class="faq-question">What if I give FenuHealth Products to my horse twice in the same day?</p>
            <p class="faq-answer">
              Brilliant - we advise to divide all FenuHealth Products over a number of feeds. Should your horse get twice the recommended amount of any FenuHealth Products in one day, your horse will be fine. We advise you to split up one day’s amount between all of your feeds for optimum results. Many horses have shown benefits when being given a double serving on days that they travel and compete.

            <p class="faq-question">Do I use a full serving of FenuHealth Products with a pony</p>

            <p class="faq-question">I left the lid off my FenuHealth tub overnight. Is it still good to use?</p>
            <p class="faq-answer">
              The lid on the tub helps to protect the product from moisture and contaminants. Leaving the lid off for one night may not pose any risk, but should be avoided.

            <p class="faq-question">The FenuHealth Products I just purchased looks slightly different from the FenuHealth Products we just finished. Is this normal?</p>
            <p class="faq-answer">
              The ingredients are derived from 100% natural sources. As a result, some variation in colour and consistency may be visible. Manufacturers of supplements often add fillers to their products to minimize the variation that naturally occurs. FenuHealth uses no such fillers. Slight variations in colour or consistency have no bearing on product effectiveness or utility.
