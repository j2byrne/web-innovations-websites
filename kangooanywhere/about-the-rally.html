              You can take any car, as long as it’s crap and with an engine of 1 litre or less. For motorbikes, we've generously allowed 125cc, but would prefer it to be a scooter. You need to drive a small, shit car to make the rally tougher. It's no fun if it's too easy. If you want easy go for a spa weekend. With a small car, you're more likely to break down so you're more likely to interact with the locals, so you can remind yourself you're alive without jamming a fork into your eyeballs.

              We could tell you everything you need to know about all the countries, roads and borders between here and Mongolia to ensure you have a safe, uncomplicated journey. But if it's not dangerous and you aren't lost, you're not on an adventure. That means no on the road backup or support. If you get stuck or in trouble, you need to solve the problem yourself. Any ‘Help! We’re broken down in Tajikistan,’ type phone calls to Rally HQ will be met with a snort of derision and a click of the receiver.

              It only seems fair that if you’re having the mother of all adventures you should give a little back, so we ask teams on the Rally to raise a minimum of £1000 for charity. £500 of this must go to our official charity Cool Earth. The other £500 can be donated to a charity of your choice.
