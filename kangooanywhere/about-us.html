              Why do I want to do the Mongol Rally?... It's a question I get asked a lot, sometimes with an air of genuine curiosity and intrigue and other times in a 'why the f*** would you do that' tone. It's an interesting question. The obvious answer is 'I want to have a cool adventure and raise some money for charity along the way'.

              However, for me it also goes slightly deeper. I am a 23 old Irish man who has never truly been taken out of his comfort zone. I have been on amazing holidays and trips but I have never had the experience of being completely self-dependant in a sometimes-hostile environment. I want to see a side of the world that is normally reserved for news bulletins and pictures online.

            <p class="para">
              I want to meet people who are completely unlike myself. People with different attitudes and customs who could open my eyes to an entirely different culture. I want to be scared out of my wits while driving through across a brutal landscape with no civilisation is sight. So yes, the Mongol Rally is a great adventure and a chance to raise money for some great causes. It is also a chance to experience things like I never have before and maybe scare the shit out of myself a little.

              After hearing about the Mongol Rally, I knew it was the kind of adventure I would love. I have a passion for cars and find the idea of trekking through the unknown in a completely unsuitable car to be amazing. The Mongol Rally really is a once in a lifetime opportunity, so when the chance arose to do it, I knew I had no excuses to not do it.

              Since Im finishing college in May, I decided the Mongol Rally was the perfect adventure before entering the working world. Im really looking forward to meeting people of so many different cultures, especially after hearing stories from those who have done the rally before. I guess I could say that a love of travelling led me to do the rally.

              The minute I heard of the Mongol Rally, around three years ago now, it was straight on the bucket list. Since then it was really a ‘when’ rather than an ‘if’ question. The 2017 Rally, due to a number of factors, suited perfectly. With everything falling into place nicely (so far). Finishing college in May, having had sufficient time to get some sort of plan and most importantly, finding two fellow rally enthusiasts, Max and Marcos. I would want to like these fellas, considering we’ll be squishing into some sorry description of a car to get to Mongolia, good thing I do.

              My personal motivation to do this rally can be summed up into two main points. Firstly, the opportunity to experience a unique adventure, where you have next to no idea how it will all unfold. The uncertainty of the whole rally is something that really appeals to me, and something that is not particularly easy to find in the modern world. Secondly, experiencing the culture and landscapes of many countries where tourism is limited. I guess simply put, if I wasn’t doing this rally, I could never see myself going to Uzbekistan.

              Ultimately, rather than ‘why’, I considered ‘why not’. I haven’t found any reason as of yet to not take this on, I’ll see how I feel at the end!
