						Sometimes it is difficult to express and explain certain experiences and feelings by using words. Art Therapy can overcome this 
						difficulty as it uses art materials and art making as a way of communication. With the help of a trained art therapist, Art Therapy 
						can provide an avenue for exploration by the use of different art materials and their particular textures and characteristics.
					</p>
					<p>
						There is no need to be artistic because the main objective is not to make an aesthetically pleasing art piece but to create 
						something that it is meaningful to you.
					</p>
					<p>
						The art therapist does not judge or interpret the images. The client is encouraged to understand the meaning of their own art work 
						and its significance.
					</p>
					<p>
						Art Therapy is used to assist individuals with a number of issues including:
						<ul class="ul-home">
							<li>Bereavement</li>
							<li>Trauma involving physical, mental or sexual abuse</li>
							<li>Improve cognitive abilities</li>
							<li>Deal with the challenges of serious diseases like cancer</li>
							<li>Help with mental disorders such as schizophrenia or depression</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>
						In addition to these challenges, Art Therapy can help individuals to relieve stress, increase self awareness and develop healthy and 
						effective coping skills.
